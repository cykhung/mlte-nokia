## Pluto Demo - Rx
The following files are used to demonstrate how to use the Pluto radio to capture RF signal over the air and use the LTE Toolbox to lock on to PSS/SSS and decode MIB and SIB1.

* **MIBDemo.ppt** - PowerPoint slides.
* **capture.m**   - MATLAB file that uses Pluto radio to do one capture.
* **capture.mat** - MATLAB MAT-file that stores the IQ baseband complex samples (variable *x*) and sampling rate (variable *fs*)
* **SIB1RecoveryExample\SIB1RecoveryExample.m** - This is the main MATLAB script to run the demo. To run the demo:
    
    \>> cd SIB1RecoveryExample
    
    \>> SIB1RecoveryExample
